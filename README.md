# Tiles

A game inspired by [Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul), with an AI that can play against you.

**[Play here!](https://domwil.co.uk/games/tiles/)**

This repo is the web gui for the game. The library implementing the game logic is [https://github.com/domw95/azul-tiles](https://github.com/domw95/azul-tiles).

## AI

The AI uses the minimax algorithm with my [minimaxer](https://github.com/domw95/minimaxer) library. [ Read this post](https://domwil.co.uk/posts/azul-ai/) for more info.
